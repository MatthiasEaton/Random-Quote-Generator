# Random-Quote-Generator
Find new quotes and learn about great minds!

In this project, I followed along with a youtube tutorial for the basic functions, then added to it. I styled the page with a background image, pictures of the quote author, and a brief discription of the authors. I also added an effect to fade seamlessly into the next quote when the generator botton is clicked and a link to the author's wikepedia page when you click on their image.
